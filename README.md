# RLAB320H9-1-ReactTodoApp
 This application is an assignment RLAB320H9.1 - To create a Todo List
 with the following objectives:
 •	Use the useReducer and/or useImmerReducer hook to manage state with reducer functions.
•	Use useState in places where reducers are not appropriate or necessary.
•	Implement controlled forms and inputs.
•	Effectively decide where pieces of state should live.
•	Use conditional rendering and conditional styling to provide a positive, interactive user experience.
•	Create a complete React application from a set of desired functionality.

I used the method I follow for any todo list, it must align with the values that are highest in priority in one of the 7 areas in life that I follow. This helps me stay focused and allocate time on what is truely important to me. At the bottom I show the percentage of tasks by category (Value) to show you where you spend your time.

Ideas For Future Updates:
• Authentication
• Log data to a DB
• Integrate User tied to Goals tied to Todo's
• Track todo's completed overtime to capture quarterly/Anual statistics
• Report Variance between Goals and Todo's
• Suggest alternative todo using AI based on Actual Goals
